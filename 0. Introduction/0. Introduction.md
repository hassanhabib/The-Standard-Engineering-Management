# 0.0 Why I Write These Books

Throughout my life, I've often felt not smart enough in various environmentsâ€”be it in class, at work, or in social settings. I found that knowledge often seemed overly complicated and out of reach. This frustration led me to develop the "Level 0" principle, where knowledge fits seamlessly into one's current experience, making it accessible and actionable today.

If you've ever felt that the world seems overly complicated, it's not your fault. It's the fault of those who try to communicate knowledge in a way that doesn't fit your learning pattern. It's like ordering a pizza and receiving meat and rice instead. You did your part by seeking knowledge; those who offer it must tailor it to fit your order. Many people blame themselves when they don't understand something, thinking they're stupid. But understanding is a 50/50 responsibility. The communicator must find a pattern that fits your learning style, and you must be willing to dive in and engage with the material.

By embracing the Level 0 approach, we can transform the way we learn, work, and succeed in the field of engineering. This book is my invitation to you to join me on this journey towards a simpler, more intuitive way of mastering engineering team management.

However, I understand that a book, by its nature, may not fully adapt to your unique learning style. In this digital age, I encourage you to feed this book into an AI model, allowing it to learn your learning pattern and teach you the key concepts in a way that best suits you. You are fully authorized to use the content of this open-source book to create a personalized learning experience. Together, we can harness the power of technology to unlock your full potential in mastering engineering management.
